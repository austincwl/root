Give:
var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

Correction:
const PI = 3.14;

var vs let?
let cannot be redeclared as a different type, var can
var can access a hoisted variable
let creates block scope

var vs. const?
const cannot be reassigned or redeclared, var can do both
const creates a block scope

let vs const?
let can be reassigned, const cannot.

hoisting?
variables are hoisted when the program is compiled.
This means that lines declaring variables are the
first to be run in thier scope.
