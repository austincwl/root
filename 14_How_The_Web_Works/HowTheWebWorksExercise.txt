## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?
    Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
    HTTP is the ruleset for communicating with a server
- What is a URL?
    Uniform Resource Locator
    A URL is a location for a resource on a server
- What is DNS?
    Domain Name System
    DNS converts URLs into IP addresses
- What is a query string?
    added fields to a URL.
    EX: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Query_string&action=edit
    the above link adds the following key-value pairs: 
        title = Query_string
        action = edit
- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
    GET: requests with no side-effects (doesn't change data on server)
    POST: requests with side-effects (changes data on server)
- What is an HTTP request?
    a request for data on a server following the HTTP ruleset
- What is an HTTP response?
    this is the data sent back to the client after revieving an HTTP request (requested data, or an error code)
- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
    An HTTP header contains information about the HTTP request/response. For example, requesting the same URL with a 
    different Content-Language header will allow the same link to work for different languages
    Examples: Date, Server, Content-Type, Content-Language
- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
    1. the URL is turned into an IP address
    2. an HTTP request is sent to the IP address
    3. the server sends a response to the sending client according to the request
    4. the browser renders the data recieved from the server (HTML)
    5. the browser sends more requests for recieved page dependancies
